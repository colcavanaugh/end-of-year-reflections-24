# 🌱 end of year reflections ~

hello! this is a simple webpage i made to document my reflections at the end of 2024.

### 🛠 technical bits

the site is built using vanilla web technologies:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

it's organized into three main systems:

1. **Loading Manager**: handles the coordinated loading of fonts, images, and content
2. **Content Manager**: manages the creation and transition of content sections
3. **Audio Player**: handles music playback and controls

### 🌿 design philosophy

i wanted this site to feel like a gentle, intimate space for sharing reflections. some key design choices:

- soft transitions and blur effects to create a dreamy atmosphere
- simple navigation (scroll, arrow keys, or touch)
- progressive loading to ensure a smooth entry
- minimal, focused design that centers the content
